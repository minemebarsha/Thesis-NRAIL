Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving checks the satisfiability of the first-order logic formulas with respect to some theories.
In this thesis, we implement the method which was proposed by the authors of \cite{Cimatti:2018:ILS:3274693.3230639}. 
The idea of the authors is to perform linear abstraction iteratively on non-linear formula by uninterpreted functions and if the solution set for the achieved linear formula does not satisfy the non-linear formula then this linear formula is incrementally refined by a set of axioms.
This thesis implements this method with linear abstraction by variables instead of uninterpreted functions and some heuristics aspects in SMT-RAT.
We also propose a new axiom namely Interval Constraint Propagation (ICP) axiom for refinement.
